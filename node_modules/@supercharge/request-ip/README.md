## Introduction
The `@supercharge/request-ip` package provides a function to retrieve a requestâ€™s IP address.


## Installation

```
npm i @supercharge/request-ip
```


## Usage

```js
const RequestIp = require('@supercharge/request-ip')

const ip = RequestIp.getClientIp(request)

// for example '213.211.254.97' as an IP v4 address
// or '2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334' as an IP v6 address
// or 'undefined' if no IP address is available on the given request
```

Depending on your used web framework, you may use it in a middleware or route handler:


**simple Express example**

```js
const { getClientIp } = require('@supercharge/request-ip')

const expressMiddleware = function (req, res, next) {
  req.ip = getClientIp(req)

  next()
}
```

**simple hapi route handler example:**

```js
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi')
const { getClientIp } = require('@supercharge/request-ip')

const server = new Hapi.Server({
  host: 'localhost'
})

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/login',
  handler: (request, h) => {
    const ip = getClientIp(request)

    return h.response(ip)
  }
})
```


## Detecting the IP Address
The clientâ€™s IP address may be stored in different locations of the request instance varying between services.

Hereâ€™s the order of locations in which the packages searches for the requesting IP address:

1. Checks HTTP request headers
    1. `x-forwarded-for`: this header may contain multiple IP address for (client/proxies/hops). This package extracts and returns the first IP address.
    2. `x-forwarded`, `forwarded`, `forwarded-for` as variants from `x-forwarded-for` possibly configured by proxies
    3. `x-client-ip` possibly configured by nginx
    4. `x-real-ip` possibly configured in nginx
    5. `cf-connecting-ip` from Cloudflare
    6. `fastly-client-ip` from Fastly and Firebase
    7. `true-client-ip` from Akamai and Cloudflare
    8. `x-cluster-client-ip` from Rackspace
2. Checks the HTTP connection in `request.connection` and `request.connection.socket`
3. Checks the HTTP socket in `request.socket`
4. Checks the HTTP info in `request.info`
5. Checks the raw HTTP request instance in `request.raw`
6. Checks the request context used by AWS API Gateway/Lambda in `request.requestContext`


## Credits
A huge thank you to [Petar Bojinov](https://github.com/pbojinov) for his [request-ip](https://github.com/pbojinov/request-ip) package. I was using Petarâ€™s package for two years in my [hapi-rate-limitor](https://github.com/futurestudio/hapi-rate-limitor) plugin. It seems Petar is busy with other work and I felt the need to create my own package providing the functionality to retrieve a requestâ€™s IP address.
